== Choosing an Operating Mode

Before deploying {project_name} in a production environment you need to decide which type of operating mode
you are going to use.  Will you run {project_name} within a cluster?  Do you want a centralized way to manage
your server configurations?  Your choice of operating mode effects how you configure databases, configure caching and even how you boot the server.

TIP: The {project_name} is built on top of the link:{appserver_caching_link}[_Infinispan_] distributed in-memory key/value data store. Runtime Data is automatically 
replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance and linear scalability. Replication across multiple data centers is supported.
This guide will only go over the basics for deployment within a specific mode.
