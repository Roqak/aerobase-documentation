=== Changing user / group

==== Changing the name of the Aerobase user / group

By default, {project_name} uses the user name aerobase for ownership of the {project_name} data itself.

We do not recommend changing the user/group of an existing installation because it can cause unpredictable side-effects. 
If you still want to do change the user and group, you can do so by adding the following lines to `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb`.

[source,ruby,subs="attributes+"]
----
user['username'] = "aerobase"
user['group'] = "aerobase"
----

==== Specify numeric user and group identifiers

{project_name} creates users for Aerobase-server, PostgreSQL and NGINX. You can specify the numeric identifiers for these users in `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb` as follows.

[source,ruby,subs="attributes+"]
----
user['uid'] = 1234
user['gid'] = 1234

postgresql['uid'] = 1235
postgresql['gid'] = 1235

web_server['uid'] = 1237
web_server['gid'] = 1237
