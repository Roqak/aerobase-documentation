=== {project_name} Delayed start

==== Linux delayed start

If you want to prevent {project_name} services (Aerobase-server, NGINX, PostgresSQL) from starting before a given filesystem is mounted, add the following to `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb`:

[source,ruby,subs="attributes+"]
----
# wait for /var/opt/aerobase to be mounted
high_availability['mountpoint'] = '/var/opt/aerobase'
----

==== Windows delayed start

[source,ruby,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Delayed start service on windows
aerobase_server['delayed_start'] = false

postgresql['delayed_start'] = false

nginx['delayed_start'] = false
----
