=== Distribution directory structure

This chapter walks you through the directory structure of the server distribution.

.distribution directory structure

Let's examine the purpose of some of the directories:

_/opt/aerobase/ - C:/{project_name}/_::
  This contains {project_name} core software and its dependencies.

_/var/opt/aerobase/ - C:/{project_name}/Data/_::
  This contains application data and configuration files that aerobase-ctl reconfigure writes to.

_/etc/aerobase/ - C:/{project_name}/Configuration/_::
  This contains configuration files for aerobase-ctl. These are the only files that you should ever have to edit manually.

_/var/log/aerobase - C:/{project_name}/Logs/_::
  This contains all log data generated by components of aerobase-ctl.

_/etc/aerobase/ssl/ - C:/{project_name}/Configuration/ssl_::
  This contains ssl configuration files for running {project_name} with https.

_/var/opt/aerobase/aerobase-server/themes/ - C:/{project_name}/Data/aerobase-server/themes/_::
  This directory contains all the html, style sheets, JavaScript files, and images used to display any UI screen displayed by the server.
  Here you can modify an existing theme or create your own.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information on this.
