=== Connecting to external database
By default {project_name} reconfigure process will generate SQL Users/Schema/Tables required for runtime.
If required object is already exists in database, it will be skiped. Therefore it is safe to run reconfigure command multiple times.

NOTE: Configuration username/password are used only during the reconfigure process.
