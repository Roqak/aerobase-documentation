== Server Initialization

After performing all the installation and configuration tasks defined in the link:{installguide_link}[{installguide_name}],
you will need to create an initial admin account.
{project_name} does not have any configured admin account out of the box.
This account will allow you to create an admin that can log into the _master_ realm's administration console so that
you can start creating realms, users and registering applications to be secured by {project_name}.

If your
server is accessible from `localhost`, you can boot it up and create this admin user by going to the http://localhost/auth/admin/aerobase/console URL.

.Welcome Page

Simply specify the username and password (admin/123) you want for this initial admin.

If you cannot access the server via a `localhost` address, or just want to activate {project_name} master from the command line
you can do this with the `aerobase-ctl recover` script.

The parameters are a little different depending on your deployment OS. here is how you use the script.

.Linux/Unix
[source]
----
$ aerobase-ctl recover <password>
----

.Windows
[source]
----
> aerobase-ctl.bat recover <password>
----
[NOTE]
.Reboot
